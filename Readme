### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because Ansible is easy to use, agentless and playbooks are written in yaml

my_playbook2.yml 

---

- name: Configure Elk VM with Docker
  hosts: Elk
  remote_user: azadmin
  become: true
  tasks:
    # Use apt module
    - name: Install docker.io
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        force_apt_get: yes
        name: docker.io
        state: present

    # Use apt module
    - name: Install python3-pip
      apt:
        force_apt_get: yes
        name: python3-pip
        state: present

    # Use pip module(It will default to pip3)
    - name: Install Docker module
      pip:
        name: docker
        state: present

    # Use Command module
    - name: Increase virtual memory
      command: sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

    # Use sysctl module
    - name: Use more memory
      sysctl:
        name: vm.max_map_count
        value: 262144
        state: present
        reload: yes

    # Use docker_container module
    - name: download and launch a docker elk container
      docker_container:
        name: elk
        image: sebp/elk:761
        state: started
        restart_policy: always
        # Please list the ports that ELK runs on
        published_ports:
          -  5601:5601
          -  9200:9200
          -  5044:5044

    # Use systemd module
    - name: Enable service docker on boat
      systemd:
        name: docker
        enabled: true

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Install ELK 
- Create filebeat configuration file
- Create metricbeat playbook

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.


### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- web-1 10.0.0.7
- web-2 10.0.0.8
We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- web-1 10.0.0.7
- web-2 10.0.0.8
These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
1- filebeat collects linux logs. This allows us to track things like user logon events, failed access attempts, service start and stops.
2- Metricbeat collects system metrics from the webservers. We look for things like cpu usage, memory usage, drive space usage and drive space avaiable for each host. 

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the ansible.cfg file to etc/ansible.
- Update the host file to include the IP addresses of the VM's
- Run the playbook, and navigate to Ansible/yml to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
